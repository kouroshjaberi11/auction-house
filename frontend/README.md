This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Progress

Completed everything for smart contracts and most of frontend. Some aspects such as viewing images could be better, as well as some error handling on the frontend. However, the contracts do a good job to prevent malicious activities, so that's why the frontend is not the best at error handling.

With regards to NFTStorage, I wasn't sure how to get pending images in time unfortunately, as a result all the NFTs will have a placeholder image.

Given more time, I would ensure to figure out NFTStorage issues and to polish up the frontend appearance and error handling, as well fix some of the issues with viewing images on NFTStorage, as they take a long time to load.
