This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Progress

Completed everything for smart contracts and most of frontend. Some aspects such as viewing live auctions, owned NFT's, currently selling NFT's, more information about an NFT can't be tested/done on frontend due to issues with NFTStorage taking a long time to save images. If this is fixed then I can start testing.
